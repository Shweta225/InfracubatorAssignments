Prerequisites for Docker Ninja training
 
For the workshop, we will be using Rancher-desktop or docker with colima. If you have docker desktop for mac and already have a license, skip step 1 & 2 . 



Uninstall Docker For Mac (Skip if not installed)
Click On Docker Icon
Select Preferences
Select Bug Icon for the Troubleshoot menu (Bomb Icon in older Docker UI)
Select Uninstall
brew uninstall docker
brew unlink docker-completion


Install docker, docker-compose and Rancher-desktop
brew install docker
brew install docker-compose
Install Rancher-desktop from here, https://rancherdesktop.io/ 

OR

Install docker, docker-compose and colima
brew install colima
brew install docker
brew install docker-compose
Run ```colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8 --disk 40```

Download images inside Docker runtime running as Docker Desktop
docker images  (empty list)
docker pull ubuntu
docker pull nginx 
docker pull golang:alpine 
docker pull golang
docker pull redis
docker pull redis:alpine
docker images ( should see above 6 images in list)
	
Download/clone sample project repo and run test
brew update &&  brew install golang
git clone https://github.com/docker-ninja/go-app.git (clone repo from github)
build  appmb
cd go-app 
make build (generate binary file of go-app)
go run main.go (run generated binary file)
Execute in a new terminal -> curl http://localhost:8080/ (checking if all is   running fine, you should be able to see hello message in response)

Create an account on Docker Store here: https://hub.docker.com (You will need this for pushing images to docker hub registry)
